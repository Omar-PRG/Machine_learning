Linear_regression exemple

We create synthetic data using X for input features and y for target values. This data is then split into training
and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split function. We establish a LinearRegression model, which we train
with the training data. This model is then used to predict outcomes for the test data. To assess performance, we calculate 
the Mean Squared Error (MSE). In conclusion, we display the linear regression line's coefficients (slope) and intercept, along with the computed MSE.

Random Forest

We use the Random Forest algorithm in Python to solve a classification problem. This involves predicting categories for data based
on its features. We start by creating some pretend data and dividing it into groups for training and testing. Then, we build a Random 
Forest model using the training data, which is like a team of decision-making trees. This model learns from the training data to make predictions. 
When we test it with new data, it predicts categories, and we check how accurate its predictions are. This helps us see how well the model is performing.
In the end, we measure and display the accuracy of the Random Forest model to understand how good it is at classification.

Neural network

In this example, we're using a neural network to solve a more advanced problem. We're working on a classification task where we want the network to 
predict categories for data. First, we generate some made-up data. Then, we split it into groups for training and testing. Our neural network has multiple layers,
like a team of decision-makers. We train the network to learn patterns in the training data. After that, we test its predictions using the test data. By
hecking how often it's right, we can measure how well it's doing. This helps us understand if the network is good at classifying. We're using more complex 
settings here, like different activation functions and optimization methods, to make the network smarter. In the end, we find out and display how accurate
the neural network is at the classification task.
