Linear_regression exemple

We create synthetic data using X for input features and y for target values. This data is then split into training
and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split function. We establish a LinearRegression model, which we train
with the training data. This model is then used to predict outcomes for the test data. To assess performance, we calculate 
the Mean Squared Error (MSE). In conclusion, we display the linear regression line's coefficients (slope) and intercept, along with the computed MSE.

Random Forest
We use the Random Forest algorithm in Python to solve a classification problem. This involves predicting categories for data based
on its features. We start by creating some pretend data and dividing it into groups for training and testing. Then, we build a Random 
Forest model using the training data, which is like a team of decision-making trees. This model learns from the training data to make predictions. 
When we test it with new data, it predicts categories, and we check how accurate its predictions are. This helps us see how well the model is performing.
In the end, we measure and display the accuracy of the Random Forest model to understand how good it is at classification.
